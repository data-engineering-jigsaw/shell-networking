As we'll see, this includes both our local computer and a computer hosting a website, like our EC2 machine.  We can use our knowledge of IP addresses to potentially restrict which computers can access our EC2 machine.  We'll also learn about network ports, which will allow to enable access to specific services on our EC2 machine, while preventing access to our entire computer."
